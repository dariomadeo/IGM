main.m
-- This is the main file, used to load data, perform estimation, simulate the system and plot

estimate.m 
-- This file is called by main.m. It performs the estimation of parameters by using lsqcurvefit built-in Matlab function.

simode.m 
-- This file is used to simulate the model by solving the corresponding set of differential equations with ode45 built-in Matlab function.

model.m
-- This file evaluates the right hand side of the differential equations composing the model

downloadItalianCovidData.m
-- This file downloads the data from the GitHub account of Protezione Civile Italiana

setParameter.m
-- This file is used to set the parameters type (constant and known, constant and unknown, time-varying and unknown), lower bound, upped bound and initial guess for the estimation.
 
getParameter.m
-- This file is used to read the estimated values of the parameters.
